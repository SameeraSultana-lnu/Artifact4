Objective: The goal of this artifact was to visualize sentiment trends and patterns from Twitter data related to future-focused discussions. It was created to demonstrate how sentiment analysis results can be effectively communicated using business intelligence tools. This project showcases the integration of data science techniques and interactive dashboards to drive meaningful insights.

Process:
  1. Data Collection: Downloaded a labeled tweet dataset focused on future-related topics from Kaggle.
  2. Preprocessing: Cleaned the tweet text to remove noise such as special characters, URLs, and stopwords. Standardized the data to prepare it for analysis.
  3. Sentiment Analysis: Used existing sentiment labels from the Kaggle dataset to categorize tweets into Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
  4. Data Structuring: Organized the cleaned and labeled data into a structured format (CSV) suitable for analysis and import into Power BI.

Power BI Visualization: Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI with visual elements like:
  a. Sentiment distribution (bar/pie charts)
  b. Sentiment trends over time
  c. Keyword-based filtering
  d. Volume of tweets by sentiment type and time
  e. Interactivity: Enabled slicers and filters for users to explore sentiments by date, sentiment type, and keyword/topic.
